# Naming Convention of Cloud Adoption Framework (CAF)

[naming-conventions.bicep](./naming-conventions.bicep) is a Bicep file that defines a set of user-defined functions to implement a naming convention for Azure resources. 
The naming convention implements the naming convention of the Azure Cloud Adoption Framework (CAF), as described on [Azure Resource Naming Best Practices](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/ready/azure-best-practices/resource-naming). 

How the functions work is described in the blog post [Apply Azure naming convention using Bicep functions](https://ronaldbosma.github.io/blog/2024/06/05/apply-azure-naming-convention-using-bicep-functions/).
